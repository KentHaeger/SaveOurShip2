Changes published Nov 24 2026

New things and notable changes:
- Quest shuttles can land on Shuttle Bays and Salvage Bays and don't need shuttle landing beacons in this case.
- Larger than 250x250 player ship map is supported when moving to a new planet. Requires initiating move to a new planet command in new version.
- Larger than 250x250 maps are supported for enemy ships.
- When entering enemy shuttles, player no longer looses control of the pawn, shuttle is claimed instead.
- Biotech DLC: kids will now have new learning desire, admiring space. Need some kind of telecope for that. That feature is intended to replace Skydreaming and Nature running which are not possible in space. Those learning desires are fixed, kid won't pick them in space.
- Bug Fix/Rework: Small Cannon and several other turret projectiles will no longer explode pematurely without hull damage.
	- They were doing damage generally, but not always.
	- In space battles, explosion size reduced from 5-tiles cross to 1 tile for small Cannon Turrets to make up for getting guaranteed hits. Their projectile for ground defence mode was not changed.
	- Damage value wasn't changed, as it affects Point Deffece efficieny.
	- Small Cannon efficiensy against hull is expected to stay roughly the same.
	- Same fix applied to shuttle laser which used to almost always explode prematurely and not damage hull.
- Quest (Spoilers): Finding starship bow will now have a timeout, so that scan results aren't spammed by quest location player can't complete in early game.
- Quest (Spoilers): JT Drive event map can be settled after quest is done.
Fixes:
- Fixed shuttles issue causing Null Reference Exceptions for shuttles in transit during ship battle.
- Scanners and science consoles will now automatically end observation for abandoned maps.
- Starship bow won't be found as general wreck, only as special location.
- Wall lights don't block tile for shuttles.
- Faster background rendering by Cn-mjt44
- Animals no longer un-tame when claiming wrecks.
- Fixed performance issue when using Vanilla Achievements Expanded and having large ship.
- Fixed destroying vehicles on map removal, which caused fleeing enemy ship with shuttles going wrong, map not removed.

- Pawn jobs are now cleared when moving to a new planet. 
- Ships with NeverRandom tag won't appear in random fleets.

- Breathable zone won't be automatically created on wrecks, only on ships. As auto-allowing zoned pawns to go to any wreck was dangerous.

- Glittertech salvage bay will no longer retrieve landing/departing shuttles and other skyfallers.
- Many occupied containers such as Biotech ones like Softscanner/Ripscanner, Biosculpter pods and VFE Draincaskets will work correctly when moving ship, won't drop occupants.

- Abandon option is available for landed ship map. For this to work, entering landed ship map in new version is required.
- Restricted area around ship will check for obstacles correctly, showing items and filth. Previously, items and filth were disallowed in restricted yellow tiles around new ship location, but not for ship location itself. Caused real confusion on why can't move/land ship.
- Shuttles that are unable to launch because of rotated will now tell about that in warning.
- Archotech Spore no longer disappears when loading save with shuttle mid-flight.
- Fixed broken wall light causing ship move issues on Old Destroyer, Armed Transport, Firefly class transport. Staring ship battle in new version is required for fix to take effect. 
- Fixed incorrect fallback when being attacked by single enemy ship, that sometimes caused too hard enemies.
- Removed incorrect 2-layer hull plating on damaged satellites.

- When converting hull plating to Archotech, floors will be preserved.
- After pawns and mechs were moved aside to allow ship movement, they won't be stuck.
- Outer airlocks airlocks won't flick on landed ship, as they are not adjacent to vacuum in this case.
- With ship map physics enabled, docking extender floors will be correctly considered ship part and pawns won't fall off  to graveyard map from there.

- Removed Need Warm Clothes Alert for space maps

- Heatsink, cloaking device and shields temporary disabled for enemy shuttles - won't generate.
- Fixed yellow log error on loading turrets - they were added with null upgrade key.

Shuttle fixes in this update were observed to reduce amount of vehicle errors dramatically. Like ship battle with enemy Strike Carrier and no shutlle log errors at all, from start to running a game with enemy shuttles left after battle.
