Changes published Nov 24 2024

New things and notable changes:
- Quest shuttles can land on Shuttle Bays and Salvage Bays and don't need shuttle landing beacons in this case.
- Larger than 250x250 player ship map is supported when moving to a new planet. Requires initiating move to a new planet command in new version.
- Larger than 250x250 maps are supported for enemy ships.
- When entering enemy shuttles, player no longer looses control of the pawn, shuttle is claimed instead.
- Biotech DLC: kids will now have new learning desire, admiring space. Need some kind of telecope for that. That feature is intended to replace Skydreaming and Nature running which are not possible in space. Those learning desires are fixed, kid won't pick them in space.
- Bug Fix/Rework: Small Cannon and several other turret projectiles will no longer explode pematurely without hull damage.
	- They were doing damage generally, but not always.
	- In space battles, explosion size reduced from 5-tiles cross to 1 tile for small Cannon Turrets to make up for getting guaranteed hits. Their projectile for ground defence mode was not changed.
	- Damage value wasn't changed, as it affects Point Deffece efficieny.
	- Small Cannon efficiensy against hull is expected to stay roughly the same.
	- Same fix applied to shuttle laser which used to almost always explode prematurely and not damage hull.
- Quest (Spoilers): Finding starship bow will now have a timeout, so that scan results aren't spammed by quest location player can't complete in early game.
- Quest (Spoilers): JT Drive event map can be settled after quest is done.
Fixes:
- Fixed shuttles issue causing Null Reference Exceptions for shuttles in transit during ship battle.

- Pawn jobs are now cleared when moving to a new planet. 
- Ships with NeverRandom tag won't appear in random fleets.

- Abandon option is available for landed ship map. For this to work, entering landed ship map in new version is required.

- Archotech Spore no longer disappears when loading save with shuttle mid-flight.

- Outer airlocks airlocks won't flick on landed ship, as they are not adjacent to vacuum in this case.
