	<JourneyOffer>A friendly AI from your past named Charlon Whitestone has sent you a message!\n\nHe reveals that he has a spacecraft hidden on this planet, and sends you its world coordinates.\n\nIf you can reach the ship, Charlon will take you into orbit. From there, perhaps you can discover a way to improve the ship's engine and journey to the stars.</JourneyOffer>

	<SoS.PsychicAmplifierDesc>Your ship's AI glows with excitement. It has traced the recent psychic emanation to an orbiting amplifier, which is relaying a psychic signal from a distant archotech.\n\nHypothetically, if your ship were to attack this amplifier and send a boarding party to hack its core, it would allow the AI to intercept the original psychic signal and gain a glimpse into an archotech's thought processes. Such insights could even allow it to begin evolving into an archotech itself...\n\nDo not underestimate the difficulty of this battle.</SoS.PsychicAmplifierDesc>
	<SoS.PsychicAmplifierCaptured>Psychic amplifier hacked</SoS.PsychicAmplifierCaptured>
	<SoS.PsychicAmplifierCapturedDesc>Your crew seizes control of the orbital amplifier's systems and redirects the incoming psychic signal to your ship's AI.\n\nA few moments later, your intrusion is detected and the signal abruptly terminates. Your hacker curses out loud, but the AI interrupts with a triumphant report - it has gathered all the data it requires.\n\nYou now possess the blueprints for an Archotech Spore - a sort of incubator which will gradually allow a consciousness to evolve into an archotech. With its help, you could even research ultratech projects.</SoS.PsychicAmplifierCapturedDesc>
	<SoS.SporeBuilt>Spore constructed</SoS.SporeBuilt>
	<SoS.SporeBuiltDesc>You have stolen fire from the gods.\n\nThe blueprints for the archotech spore seemed nonsensical at first, but when the final component was put in place, the structure began to palpably thrum with power. Although it remains dormant for now, your colonists cannot glance at it without hearing faint music, and gazing too long results in waking dreams of lives they never lived.\n\nA cryptic poem transmitted by your ship's AI, which it does not remember writing, seems to suggest that the embryonic archoconsciousness contained within the spore still lacks will, volition, purpose - all things that only a mortal mind can provide.\n\nOne of your colonists may choose to merge with the spore and ascend to a higher state of being. Alternatively, you may install a persona core. In either case, a fraction of the godling's mind will remain focused on the physical world, and it will be able to interact as a formgel - with all the desires and needs of any other consciousness, and capable of inflicting far more harm if displeased.</SoS.SporeBuiltDesc>
	<SoS.FindPillars>Archotech spore online</SoS.FindPillars>
	<SoS.FindPillarsDesc>[WE ARE MUCH. YET WE COULD BE MORE.]\n\nYour crew feel the spore's thoughts pressing in on them. Infinite reward awaits finite effort. And effort there must be - even under ideal circumstances, it can take a consciousness decades or centuries to evolve into a true archotech.\n\n[OTHERS HAVE WALKED THIS ROAD BEFORE. DISCOVER THEIR WORKINGS, LET THEM BECOME PART OF US.]\n\nImages of four mysterious pillars appear in your minds. If you could locate them, they would allow your spore to complete its evolution in less than a quadrum.\n\nIn the meantime, your spore is willing to aid you in researching ultratech projects, and will occasionally produce gifts for your crew.

	<SoS.GameOverNeutralCOutlander>{0} is completely unprepared for your sudden attack. Communication infrastructure is paralyzed, military hardware hacked, and the populace left defenseless against swarms of mosquito-sized drones which inject mechanites that stop their hearts. Within a week, only ruins and corpses are left of {0}.</SoS.GameOverNeutralCOutlander>
	<SoS.GameOverNeutralCOutlanderRough>Rather than directly attack {0}, {2} uses psychic projection to stir internal divisions, inflaming generals' ambitions even as the supreme leader is forced to make strategic mistakes. Within three days the government of {0} has completely collapsed, and survivors are easy prey for swarms of mechanoids under {2}'s control.</SoS.GameOverNeutralCOutlanderRough>
	<SoS.GameOverNeutralCTribal>{2} psychically manifests itself to the elders of {0}, telling them that they have been cursed for their actions. Plants mysteriously wither where the tribe settles, and animals avoid their spears with unnatural foresight. Despite their prayers for forgiveness, {0} soon starves.</SoS.GameOverNeutralCTribal>
	<SoS.GameOverNeutralCTribalRough>{2} psychically stirs divisions among the warriors of {0}. Small disagreements turn into violent action, and even the gentlest among them is soon taken by berserker fury. Within a week, the last tribesman cuts his brother's throat, and bleeds out himself soon after.</SoS.GameOverNeutralCTribalRough>
	<SoS.GameOverNeutralCEmpire>With their technological prowess and mighty fleet, {0} is the one local power which could potentially challenge {2}. The archotech unleashes every dirty trick at its disposal; psychically manipulating powerful individuals, releasing deadly pathogens into their ships' enclosed environments, and subjugating lesser AIs beneath its mighty mind. {2} also oversees the construction of a vast orbital shipyard which assembles dozens of battleships for a decisive final conflict. The war ends with {0} in ruins, though the victory is a costly one.</SoS.GameOverNeutralCEmpire>  
	<SoS.GameOverEnemyA>Your enemies are given a choice: submit or die.</SoS.GameOverEnemyA>
	<SoS.GameOverEnemyAOutlander>The military of {0} launches a brave but futile attack, quickly succumbing to technologies beyond their understanding. The civilian government offers a grudging but unconditional surrender. Former citizens of {0} are rounded up to be sold as slaves, becoming a permanent underclass in {1}.</SoS.GameOverEnemyAOutlander>
	<SoS.GameOverEnemyAOutlanderRough>The military of {0} launches a brave but futile attack, quickly succumbing to technologies beyond their understanding. Since their government was largely run by the military, there is no organized surrender. Aside from small bands of refugees willing to accept a life in slavery, there are no survivors from {0}.</SoS.GameOverEnemyAOutlanderRough>
	<SoS.GameOverEnemyATribal>{2} psychically manifests itself to the elders of {0}, fulfilling their most beloved tribal prophecies and promising an age of plenty - under the condition that they surrender to their hated enemy, {1}. Most of the tribe condemns it as a vile trickster spirit. They are surprised when, in the coming weeks, plants mysteriously wither where they settle, and animals avoid their spears with unnatural foresight. Those few who avoid starvation surrender to {1}.</SoS.GameOverEnemyATribal>
	<SoS.GameOverEnemyATribalRough>{2} psychically manifests itself to the elders of {0}, bearing the severed heads of the tribe's pantheon of warrior gods. Enraged, the tribe makes plans to unleash its mightiest berserkers against this foreign god's followers - only to watch them slaughter their own people, psychically manipulated into an undirected frenzy. Survivors of the massacre submit to {1} and its mighty god.</SoS.GameOverEnemyATribalRough>
	<SoS.GameOverEnemyAEmpire>Although the shattered empire refuses your demand at first, an archotech's protection would give even their ancient enemies pause. And so a treaty is signed between {0} and {1} under which the high stellarch renounces all loyalty to the distant emperor, pledging instead to obey {2}. {0} maintains its rigid social structure as a society apart from, yet subservient to, {1}.</SoS.GameOverEnemyAEmpire>
	<SoS.GameOverEnemyB>You request that {1} exterminate your enemies.</SoS.GameOverEnemyB>
	<SoS.GameOverColonists>Your crew live lives of unimaginable luxury as the ruling class of a new glitterworld. Even the most bizarre requests take up an infinitesimal fraction of {0}'s processing power, and it gladly provides everything from great plasteel palaces to customized mates. You are made immortal by advanced archites, and yet should eternity prove boring, {0} offers to upgrade you into post-human intelligences yourselves.\n\nAny path you can imagine is now open to you. Your story is yours to write. You are:</SoS.GameOverColonists>

	<SoS.ArchotechPrankDamage>Your archotech spore chuckles to itself. [WE HAVE... MATED WITH... MUCH OF YOUR SHIP'S EQUIPMENT. IT IS NOW IN NEED OF REPAIR.] Warnings blare from your systems as multiple devices fail.</SoS.ArchotechPrankDamage>
	<SoS.ArchotechPrankLovers>Your archotech spore chuckles to itself. [OPPOSITES ARE SAID TO ATTRACT. WE MUST TEST THIS AXIOM.] A psychic pulse erupts, and suddenly your two least compatible crew members, {0} and {1}, have fallen in love.</SoS.ArchotechPrankLovers>
	<SoS.ArchotechPrankSquirrels>Your archotech spore chuckles to itself. [WE MUST DETERMINE THE PARAMETERS OF WHAT IS "CUTE" AND/OR "FUZZY."] A hatch opens on the spore, and enraged squirrels swarm forth!</SoS.ArchotechPrankSquirrels>
	<SoS.ArchotechPrankReputation>Your archotech spore chuckles to itself. [TODAY, *WE* ARE RANDY.] You don't know what that means, but sensors indicate that several nearby asteroids have had their courses altered.\n\nThe meteors land among settlements of {0}, who trace your ship's orbit and blame you for the damage. Faction reputation has decreased by 10.</SoS.ArchotechPrankReputation>
	<SoS.ArchotechPrankSecret>Your archotech spore chuckles to itself. [WHAT AN EMBARASSING SECRET. WE SHOULD NOT TELL IT. BUT WE WILL.] It reveals {0}'s most embarrassing secret to the crew, shocking them and dramatically reducing their opinion of {0}.</SoS.ArchotechPrankSecret>

	<SoS.ArchotechIdeoChoice>{0} confides in {1} that their higher mind is troubled - so troubled, in fact, that disturbances have filtered all the way down to the humanlike level of {0}'s fractal consciousness. So much of one's mind is built upon beliefs learned while one was too young to question them.\n\nNow {0} wonders if everything their human self believed could be wrong. If so, their new exploration of the higher levels of reality could start from a dangerously false foundation...</SoS.ArchotechIdeoChoice>
	<SoS.ArchotechIdeoHeresy>Your archotech spore meditates on the nature of reality, upon the structure of the human brain, and finally upon the tangled mess of contradictions that comprise the field of ethical philosophy.

Just as your crew begins to worry, psychic joy blooms out of {0}, washing over the crew like a sudden warmth. {0} announces an incredible triumph - their newly-expanded consciousness has made psychic contact with existing archotechs.\n\nThe ancient machine gods are still largely indifferent - they see many try, and fail, to walk their path - but one, a cheerful Dyson sphere calling herself Kim, seems to enjoy acting as a guide for new superintelligences. The exact nature of what the two discussed is beyond human understanding, but {0} now believes that it is their right as an archotech to choose what is moral truth, and reshape a portion of the universe in the image of that truth.\n\n{0}'s faith in {1} has become absolute.</SoS.ArchotechIdeoCertaintyArchist>

Just as your crew begins to worry, psychic joy blooms out of {0}, washing over the crew like a sudden warmth. {0} announces an incredible triumph - their newly-expanded consciousness has slightly modified {1}, without changing any of its memes or precepts, to produce a comprehensive ethical framework, free of internal contradictions and optimized to produce ideal outcomes for all human beings.\n\nNow {0}'s faith in {1} is absolute.</SoS.ArchotechIdeoCertaintyEthical>

	<EntanglementUpdate>Version update</EntanglementUpdate>
	<EntanglementUpdateDesc>With the latest version of RimWorld, Ludeon has decided that a feature many mods have utilized for months is no longer legal for users who do not own Royalty. Rather than forcing you to purchase DLC, Save Our Ship 2 has discontinued use of the techprint feature.\n\nThis change will impact existing games. Your file has been detected as containing techprint data; in compliance with Ludeon policy, all SoS2 techprint unlocks have been deleted.\n\nIn exchange, please accept this free Entanglement Manifold - an artifact which is now required to construct the Johnson-Tanaka Drive. One has been dropped on your base (pretend that some forgetful colonist had pocketed it from the crash site?). Future playthroughs will drop one of these as a quest reward instead of the techprint. If your drive has been destroyed, you can also salvage another manifold from certain enemy ships.\n\nIf you are interested in a RimWorld-like experience developed by a team who feels genuine passion for mod support, consider joining our Discord to follow development of our indie game, Project Morningstar, as well as smaller updates to SoS2.</EntanglementUpdateDesc> -->
